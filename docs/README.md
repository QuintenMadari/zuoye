# less convoluted static md site

Abandoning hugo, looked fun but couldn't live up to its promise at deployment

## good choices

VuePress looks very good, however node dependencies are a turn off. It has great features. They do point to alternatives.
Docute.org presents a very simple way, based on a single javascript file which does the heavy lifting.

## Docute

All md files and folders in documentroot will be hosted. The structure equals the url.

index.html in docroot should contain lines as noted in docute.org quickstart.

within new docute extra options can be added.
